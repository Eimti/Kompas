# Kompas
Kompas is a card game, played on a board. Players choose one card, their Avatar, to represent themselves, then make a deck of 49 other cards to play with. The first person whose Avatar dies, loses.

# Running this
The short of it is that, for now, you can't. When I set up this repo, I had very little idea what I was doing, and so it doesn't include all that's necessary to run the game (packages and such). What's on here is the important stuff I want to keep saved - the code, jsons, and other such - but it needs to be opened in the Unity editor to do anything.
That's not to say the game doesn't run at all; it technically does. It's just that, while you can move cards around and change numbers manually, nothing happens for you at the moment, so you can't really play a game. That should change soon.
